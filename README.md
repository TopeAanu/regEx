# Regular expressions
This code gives a sneak peek of how regular expressions(regex) work. It consists of four input fields: name, username, email, and phone number. Each input has its function and is assigned a regex pattern. The 'name' input is patterned to start with an uppercase letter, the 'username' input is patterned to begin with a lowercase letter. The 'email' input takes in the necessary email format (alphanumeric, the @ symbol, and a maximum tld of 5 letters). The 'phone number' input accepts eleven digits arranged in the format of (3 3 4) and can be delimited with either a hyphen or a space.
